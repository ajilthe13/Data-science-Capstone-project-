# Data-science-Capstone-project-
In this project, I have to put myself in the shoes of an HR analytics expert, and by leveraging the data provided, and I am supposed to identify How salary is varying with respect to other considerable factors. To get and look at neater data it was also important to visualize &amp; understand the data using EDA, Statistics &amp; various plots like Correlation, bar, scatter plot, etc. The dataset was divided into test and train and I used the training data to build the model and thereby apply it to test data to measure the performance and robustness of the model.
